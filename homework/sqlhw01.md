1. **How does the book describe the difference between *imperative* and *declarative* languages?**
Imperative - you tell the computer what to do and how to do it.
declarative - you tell the computer and let the computer figure how to do it.
2. **List three categories of command statement in SQL.**
ddl, dml, dcl
3. **Give an informal definition of *database* as used in the expression "relational database management system." Give an informal definition of *database* as used in the expression "Human Resources database."**
Informal definition of database - when using term database it's in reference to a piece  of software, or program. the other meaning is a collection of data
4. **How does SQL implement three-valued predicate logic?**
true, false, unknown (labeled as null)
5. **How does SQL enforce *entity integrity?* How does SQL enforce (*referential integrity?*)**
entity integrity - Makes sure data isn't entered twice. each entity must have a unique key
referential integrity - the key to relational databases. Every data item is required  to refer to another entry on another table. (the data that is referred to is correct)
6. **What is a *relation* as defined in the textbook? A one word answer  to this question is sufficient.**
A table
7. **Is this table in first normal form? Why or why not? If it is not, how would you change it?**
no, names and creds should be separated out
8. **Is this table in second normal form? Why or why not? If it is not, how would you change it?**
no, must be broken into two tables
9. **Is this table in third normal form? Why or why not? If it is not, how would you change it?**
No, city and state are dependent on each other. you could use zip and state.
10. **List the components of a four-part object name.**

11. **What is the difference between  *declarative data integrity* and (*procedural  data integrity?*)**
declarative data integrity enforced  as part of the model where you build your database
procedural  data integrity enforced with the code
